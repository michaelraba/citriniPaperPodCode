* Part 1: Spectral Analysis Procedure

The process of taking azimuthal and streamwise FFT is described in this section. The motivation for taking in both directions is described in eg (source).

* Part 2: Snapshot POD Procedure

1. According to source (cite), the POD equation in pipe coordinates may be written as,

$$\int_{r^{\prime}} \boldsymbol{S}\left(m ; r, r^{\prime}\right) \Phi_{n}\left(m ; r^{\prime}\right) \mathrm{d} r^{\prime}=\lambda_{n}(m) \Phi_{n}(m ; r)$$

where $n$ represents the POD mode number, $\Phi_{n}$ are the eigenfunctions with the corresponding eigenvalues $\lambda_{n}$, and $m$ represents the azimuthally decomposed mode number. Here, $r$ from the polar integration is absorbed into the eigenfunctions and the cross-correlation tensor.

2. Rewrite the time-averaged cross-correlation tensor,

$$\mathbf{S}\left(m ; r, r^{\prime}\right)=\lim _{\tau \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{\tau} \int_{0}^{\tau} r^{1 / 2} \boldsymbol{u}(m ; r, t) \boldsymbol{u}^{*}\left(m ; r^{\prime}, t\right) r^{1 / 2} \mathrm{~d} t$$

3. Write the projection coefficient $\alpha$ for the radial geometry as,

   $$\alpha_{n}(m ; t)=\int_{r} \boldsymbol{u}(m ; r, t) r^{1 / 2} \Phi_{n}^{*}(m ; r) \mathrm{d} r$$

4. Then, we may rewrite the eigenvalue problem, which we will implement in the code

$$\lim_{\tau \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{\tau} \int_{0}^{\tau} r^{1 / 2} \boldsymbol{u}(m ; r, t) \alpha_{n}^{*}(m ; t) \mathrm{d} t=\Phi_{n}(m ; r) \lambda^{n}(m)$$

5. The resulting solution $alpha_n$ for $n\in \{1,\ldots , N\}$ is found from the above. From that, we may directly find the eigenfunctions $\Phi_n$, which are given by,

   $$\lim _{\tau \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{\tau} \int_{0}^{\tau} r^{1 / 2} \boldsymbol{u}(m ; r, t) \alpha_{n}^{*}(m ; t) \mathrm{d} t=\Phi_{n}(m ; r) \lambda^{n}(m)$$
