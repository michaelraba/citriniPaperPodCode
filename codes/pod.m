% follows 3.5-3.6 of citrini and george.
% function takes in fluctuation with azimuthal and streamwise fft applied.
% that 'looks' like essentially a correlation in time t direction.

% import data object.

% take inner product after multiply each (a,b) by ra and rb , r is radius
% use quad.
% use eig. The return eigvec is the alpha_n , for n eigenvalues.
% use that alpha for eq (B).
