# Description

Follows the paper by [Citrini and George 2000](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/abs/reconstruction-of-the-global-velocity-field-in-the-axisymmetric-mixing-layer-utilizing-the-proper-orthogonal-decomposition/68BAA266FC58F299B2D9DA612C8F4A6C) ,  which is used by eg, [Hellstrom and Smits 2017](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2016.0086) and [Ganapathisubramani, Hellstrom, and Smits 2015](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/abs/evolution-of-largescale-motions-in-turbulent-pipe-flow/CB2FF14595A6E552DF8A554FE489CBE9).


# Part 1: Spectral Analysis Procedure

The process of taking azimuthal and streamwise FFT is described in this section. The motivation for taking in both directions is described in eg (source).


# Part 2: Snapshot POD Procedure

According to source (cite), the POD equation in pipe coordinates may be written as,

$$\int_{r^{\prime}} \boldsymbol{S}\left(m ; r, r^{\prime}\right) \Phi_{n}\left(m ; r^{\prime}\right) \mathrm{d} r^{\prime}=\lambda_{n}(m) \Phi_{n}(m ; r)$$

where $n$ represents the POD mode number, $\Phi_{n}$ are the eigenfunctions with the corresponding eigenvalues $\lambda_{n}$, and $m$ represents the azimuthally decomposed mode number. Here, $r$ from the polar integration is absorbed into the eigenfunctions and the cross-correlation tensor.

Define the time-averaged cross-correlation tensor as

$$\mathbf{S}\left(m ; r, r^{\prime}\right)=\lim_{\tau \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{\tau} \int_{0}^{\tau} r^{1 / 2} \boldsymbol{u}(m ; r, t) \boldsymbol{u}^{*}\left(m ; r^{\prime}, t\right) r^{1 / 2} \mathrm{~d} t$$

Next write the projection coefficient $\alpha$ for the radial geometry as,

$$\alpha_{n}(m ; t)=\int_{r} \boldsymbol{u}(m ; r, t) r^{1 / 2} \Phi_{n}^{*}(m ; r) \mathrm{d} r$$

Then, we may rewrite the eigenvalue problem, which we will implement in the code

$$\lim_{\tau \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{\tau} \int_{0}^{\tau}\left(r^{1 / 2} \boldsymbol{u}(m ; r, t), r^{1 / 2} \boldsymbol{u}\left(m ; r, t^{\prime}\right)\right) \alpha_{n}(m ; t) \mathrm{d} t^{\prime}=\lambda_{n}(m) \alpha_{n}(m ; t) \,\,\,\, (Equation A)$$
 The resulting solution $\alpha_n$ for $n\in \{1,\ldots , N\}$ is found from the above. From that, we may directly find the eigenfunctions $\Phi_n$, which are given by,

$$\lim_{\tau \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{\tau} \int_{0}^{\tau} r^{1 / 2} \boldsymbol{u}(m ; r, t) \alpha_{n}^{*}(m ; t) \mathrm{d} t=\Phi_{n}(m ; r) \lambda^{n}(m)  \,\,\,\, (Equation B)$$

by solving for $\Phi_n$.
